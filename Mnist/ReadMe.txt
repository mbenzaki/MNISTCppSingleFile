    Console Application: Mnist Overview of this project
========================================================================

This is sample implementation to deep learning from scratch.
The original is written in Python, this project is implemented
by standard C11 project.

I have only checked VS2017 but all code in this project is written
in standard C11 code, so you can implement not only Visual Studio
but also Linux GCC and Mac Xcode
